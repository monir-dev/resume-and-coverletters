Hi,
In my current Software Engineer role, I have extensive experience in web development. I am working as a web developer since 2015.

I develop websites on daily basis and most of them are with PHP and Laravel. I already have working experience with third-party login providers like Google, Facebook, etc, and social media sharing like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Tumblr, etc.

I am just beginning my Freelancing on Upwork. However, I can assure you that if you work with me once, you will always work with me on these kinds of projects. I will do whatever it takes to completely 100% deliver on this project and earn a 5-star rating from you as well.

Please let me know when you would be available for an initial 15-30 minute call (free of charge) so that we can discuss your project in more detail and identify how my skill-set will work best for you.

Kind Regards,

Monir Hossain

Discuss all requirements and challenges about this project with the developer before starting.


What part of this project most appeals to you?
SnapShot Feature.

What questions do you have about the project?

There are several questions in my mind like Snapshot feature, SMTP, Admin, and user-related permission, or any additional feature? It would be better to discuss this in person. As I described earlier, my primary focus is client satisfaction and building my Upwork profile. So, I will try my best to deliver more than what you want (enhance your experience).
